# Machine Learning

KOT can be used for machine learning by storing the training data efficiently. This allows for quick and easy access to the data, which can then be used to train a machine learning model.

Here is an example of how to use KOT for machine learning:

```python
from kot import KOT
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a new instance of the KOT class to represent the training data:
training_data = KOT("training_data")

# Add the training data to the database:
training_data.set("X_train", X_train.tolist())
training_data.set("y_train", y_train.tolist())

# Retrieve the training data from the database:
X_train_retrieved = training_data.get("X_train")
y_train_retrieved = training_data.get("y_train")

# Train a machine learning model on the retrieved data
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train_retrieved, y_train_retrieved)

# Use the trained model for prediction, evaluation, etc.
```
