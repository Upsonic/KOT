# Web Scraping

Upsonic can be used for web scraping by storing the scraped data efficiently. This allows for quick and easy access to the data, which can then be processed or analyzed as needed.

Here is an example of how to use Upsonic for web scraping:

```python
from upsonic import Upsonic
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Create a new instance of the Upsonic class to represent the scraped data:
scraped_data = Upsonic("web_scraping")

# Scrape data from a website:
response = requests.get("https://example.com")
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
data = soup.find_all('div', class_='example')

# Add the scraped data to the database:
scraped_data.set("example_data", data)

# Retrieve the scraped data from the database:
retrieved_data = scraped_data.get("example_data")

# Process or analyze the retrieved data as needed:
```
