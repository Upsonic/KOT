# IoT Devices

Upsonic can be used for IoT devices by storing the data generated by the devices efficiently. This allows for quick and easy access to the data, which can then be used for monitoring, analysis, decision making, etc.

Here is an example of how to use Upsonic for IoT devices:

```python
from upsonic import Upsonic

# Create a new instance of the Upsonic class to represent the IoT data:
iot_data = Upsonic("iot_data")

# Assume we have an IoT device that generates temperature data:
temperature_data = {"device_id": "device_1", "temperature": 25.5, "timestamp": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"}

# Add the temperature data to the database:
iot_data.set("device_1", temperature_data)

# Retrieve the temperature data from the database:
retrieved_data = iot_data.get("device_1")

# The retrieved data can now be used for monitoring, analysis, decision making, etc.
```
